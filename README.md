TIC TAC TOE 

The problem statement here is to find the most optimal move in a game of tic tac toe. The objective of the game are simple. We need to get three in a row. The first player, in this case the maximizer is known as X and the second, the minimizer, is O. Players alternate placing X’ s and O’s on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. Three in a row can mean a single row, column or any of the two diagonals.
The expected input would be a 3x3 matrix marked with X’s and 0’s and ‘_’ signifying an empty space.
The output would be the most optimal move that a maximizer X can make.
We first create a minimax decision tree, by using tools of recursion and computing all paths.
